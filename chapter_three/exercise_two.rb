# What do these expressions evalutate to?

x = 2 # => 2, variable x was assigned to an integer 2, expression then has a return value of 2.

puts x = 2 # => nil, output displays 2, but puts command always returns a value of nil. 

p name = "Joe" # => "Joe", p method outputs its arguement, then displays it.

four = "four" # => "four", variable four assigned to string called "four". The expression
# will then evaluate to the string called "four".

print something = "nothing" # nothing=> displays the output nothing with return value of nil.
# Because the print command doesn't print out a new line like the puts command does, the 
# output and return value are displayed on the same line.
