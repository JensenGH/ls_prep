# What do the following expressions evaluate to?

x = 2 # => 2, Here we have variable assignment. Variable assignment will return the value of the
# assigned variable, which in this case is 2. 

puts x = 2 # => nil, the puts method will output the return value, but puts always returns nil
# so it will output 2, but return nil.

p name = "Joe" # => "Joe", p method will output it's argument and print it's arugment. Therefore,
# "Joe" to be our returned value. 

four = "four" # => "four", We have variable assignment once again. Therefore the return value
# will be the value of the assign variable which is "four".

print something = "nothing" # nothing=> nil. The print method will output the return value of 
# this assignment and then return nil. The print method doesn't append a new line onto it's output, 
# therefore the output and return value are on the same line.
